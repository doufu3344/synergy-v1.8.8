about Synergy(from wikipedia)
Synergy is a software application developed by Symless, for sharing a keyboard and mouse between multiple computers. It is used in situations where several PCs are used together, with a monitor connected to each, but are to be controlled by one user. The user needs only one keyboard and mouse on the desk â€” similar to a KVM switch without the video.
